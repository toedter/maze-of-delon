= The Maze of Delon

The Maze of Delon is my first experiment with https://babylonjs.com[Babylon.js] and https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/webXR/introToWebXR[Web based Virtual Reality (WebXR)].
This is in a very early stage, please stay tuned.

== Demo

You control the camera with the mouse, and the cursor keys.

When you have a Virtual Reality Headset running, you can click on
the icon in the bottom right corner to enable VR.
